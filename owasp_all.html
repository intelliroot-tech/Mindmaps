The API also checks for the uploaded picture's size before generating thumbnails to avoid processing pictures that are too large.\n\nAn attacker can easily bypass those mechanisms, by leveraging the flexible nature of GraphQL:\n<br><br>\n<code>\nPOST /graphql\n\n[\n  {\"query\": \"mutation {uploadPic(name: \\\"pic1\\\", base64_pic: \\\"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\\\") {url}}\"},\n  {\"query\": \"mutation {uploadPic(name: \\\"pic2\\\", base64_pic: \\\"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\\\") {url}}\"},\n  ...\n  {\"query\": \"mutation {uploadPic(name: \\\"pic999\\\", base64_pic: \\\"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\\\") {url}}\"},\n}\n</code>\nBecause the API does not limit the number of times the uploadPic operation can be attempted, the call will lead to exhaustion of server memory and Denial of Service.<br><br>\n\nScenario #3<br><br>\nA service provider allows clients to download arbitrarily large files using its API. These files are stored in cloud object storage and they don't change that often. The service provider relies on a cache service to have a better service rate and to keep bandwidth consumption low. The cache service only caches files up to 15GB.\n\nWhen one of the files gets updated, its size increases to 18GB. All service clients immediately start pulling the new version.

For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:<br><br>\n\n- Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g., between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.<br><br>\n\n- Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?<br><br>\n Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?<br><br>\n\n- Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser) security directives or headers missing?<br><br>\n\n- Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?<br><br>\n\n- Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated sufficiently secure for the cryptographic mode of operation? Is an insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption used when authenticated encryption is more appropriate?<br><br>\n\n- Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function?<br><br>\n\n8. Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability?<br><br>\n\n9. Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?<br><br>\n\n10. Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1 v1.5 in use?<br><br>\n\n11.

However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.<br><br>\n\n\nScenario #2: <br><br>\nA site doesn't use or enforce TLS for all pages or supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g., at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's session cookie. The attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user's (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the user's private data. Instead of the above they could alter all transported data, e.g., the recipient of a money transfer.<br><br>\n\n\nScenario #3: <br><br>\n\nThe password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes.

Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.<br><br>\n\n- Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.<br><br>\n\n- Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.<br><br>\n\n- Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.<br><br>\n\n- Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with forward secrecy (FS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).<br><br>\n\n- Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.<br><br>\n\n- Apply required security controls as per the data classification.<br><br>\n\n- Do not use legacy protocols such as FTP and SMTP for transporting sensitive data.<br><br>\n\n- Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2.<br><br>\n\n- Initialization vectors must be chosen appropriate for the mode of operation. For many modes, this means using a CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator). For modes that require a nonce, then the initialization vector (IV) does not need a CSPRNG. In all cases, the IV should never be used twice for a fixed key.<br><br>\n\n- Always use authenticated encryption instead of just encryption.<br><br>\n\n- Keys should be generated cryptographically randomly and stored in memory as byte arrays. If a password is used, then it must be converted to a key via an appropriate password base key derivation function.<br><br>\n\n- Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate, and that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low entropy. Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the CSPRNG to get security.<br><br>\n\n- Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and padding schemes, such as MD5, SHA1, PKCS number 1 v1.5 .<br><br>\n\n- Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and settings.<br><br></div>","symbolSize":2,"collapsed":true,"lineStyle":{"width":0.5},"itemStyle":{"borderWidth":1,"gapWidth":1}},{"name":"Injection","value":"<div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>VUL : </b>Injection</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>YEAR : </b>2021</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>DESCRIPTION : </b><br><br>An application is vulnerable to attack when:<br><br>\n\n- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.<br><br>\n\n- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.<br><br>\n\n- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.<br><br>\n\n- Hostile data is directly used or concatenated.

Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and interactive (IAST) application security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production deployment.<br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>EXAMPLE : </b><br><br>Scenario #1: <br><br>\nAn application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following vulnerable SQL call: <br><br>\n<br><br>\n<code>\nString query = \"SELECT \\* FROM accounts WHERE custID='\" + request.getParameter(\"id\") + \"'\";\n</code>\nScenario #2: <br><br>\nSimilarly, an application’s blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g., Hibernate Query Language (HQL)): <br><br>\n<br><br>\n<code>\n Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery(\"FROM accounts WHERE custID='\" + request.getParameter(\"id\") + \"'\");\nIn both cases, the attacker modifies the ‘id’ parameter value in their browser to send: ' UNION SLEEP(10);--.

There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required.<br><br>\n\nRequirements and Resource Management :-<br><br>\n\nCollect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including the protection requirements concerning confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data assets and the expected business logic. Take into account how exposed your application will be and if you need segregation of tenants (additionally to access control). Compile the technical requirements, including functional and non-functional security requirements. Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design, build, testing, and operation, including security activities.<br><br>\n\nSecure Design:-<br><br>\n\nSecure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods. Threat modeling should be integrated into refinement sessions (or similar activities); look for changes in data flows and access control or other security controls. In the user story development determine the correct flow and failure states, ensure they are well understood and agreed upon by responsible and impacted parties. Analyze assumptions and conditions for expected and failure flows, ensure they are still accurate and desirable. Determine how to validate the assumptions and enforce conditions needed for proper behaviors. Ensure the results are documented in the user story. Learn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements. Secure design is neither an add-on nor a tool that you can add to software.<br><br>\n\nSecure Development Lifecycle:-<br><br>\n\nSecure software requires a secure development lifecycle, some form of secure design pattern, paved road methodology, secured component library, tooling, and threat modeling. Reach out for your security specialists at the beginning of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance of your software. Consider leveraging the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) to help structure your secure software development efforts.<br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>EXAMPLE : </b><br><br>Scenario #1: <br><br>\n\nA credential recovery workflow might include “questions and answers,” which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and the OWASP Top 10. Questions and answers cannot be trusted as evidence of identity as more than one person can know the answers, which is why they are prohibited. Such code should be removed and replaced with a more secure design.<br><br>\n\nScenario #2: <br><br>\n\nA cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a maximum of fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers could threat model this flow and test if they could book six hundred seats and all cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive loss of income.<br><br>\n\n\nScenario #3: <br><br>\n\nA retail chain’s e-commerce website does not have protection against bots run by scalpers buying high-end video cards to resell auction websites. This creates terrible publicity for the video card makers and retail chain owners and enduring bad blood with enthusiasts who cannot obtain these cards at any price.

When the data transmission takes place, it typically goes through the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet, a threat agent listening on the wire can intercept and modify the data if it transmitted in plaintext or using a deprecated encryption protocol. Threat agents might have different motives such as stealing sensitive information, conducting espionage, identity theft and more. The following threat agents exist:<br><br>\n\nAn adversary that shares your local network (compromised or monitored Wi-Fi);<br><br>\nRogue carrier or network devices (routers, cell towers, proxy’s, etc); or<br><br>\nMalware on your mobile device.<br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>EXAMPLE : </b><br><br>Lack of certificate inspection <br><br>\n\nThe mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and perform a TLS handshake to establish a secure channel. However, the mobile app fails to inspect the certificate offered by the server and the mobile app unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint. The mobile app is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks through a TLS proxy. <br><br>\n\nWeak handshake negotiation <br><br>\n\nThe mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and negotiate a cipher suite as part of the connection handshake. The client successfully negotiates with the server to use a weak cipher suite that results in weak encryption that can be easily decrypted by the adversary. This jeopardizes the confidentiality of the channel between the mobile app and the endpoint. <br><br>\n\nPrivacy information leakage <br><br>\n\nThe mobile app transmits personally identifiable information to an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This jeopardizes the confidentiality of any privacy-related data between the mobile app and the endpoint. <br><br>\n\nCredential information leakage <br><br>\n\nThe mobile app transmits user credentials to an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This allows an adversary to intercept those credentials in cleartext. <br><br>\n\nTwo-Factor authentication bypass <br><br>\n\nThe mobile app receives a session identifier from an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This allows an adversary to bypass two-factor authentication by using the intercepted session identifier. <br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>REMEDIATION : </b><br><br>Apply SSL/TLS to transport channels that the mobile app will use to transmit data to a backend API or web service.<br><br>\nAccount for outside entities like third-party analytics companies, social networks, etc. by using their SSL versions when an application runs a routine via the browser/webkit. Avoid mixed SSL sessions as they may expose the user’s session ID.<br><br>\nUse strong, industry standard cipher suites with appropriate key lengths.<br><br>\nUse certificates signed by a trusted CA provider.<br><br>\nNever allow bad certificates (self-signed, expired, untrusted root, revoked, wrong host..).<br><br>\nConsider certificate pinning.<br><br>\nAlways require SSL chain verification.<br><br>\nOnly establish a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the key chain.<br><br>\nAlert users through the UI if the mobile app detects an invalid certificate.<br><br>\nDo not send sensitive data over alternate channels (e.g, SMS, MMS, or notifications).<br><br>\nIf possible, apply a separate layer of encryption to any sensitive data before it is given to the SSL channel.

During the processing of the request, the server code does not verify that the incoming request is associated with a known user. Hence, adversaries submit service requests to the back-end service and anonymously execute functionality that affects legitimate users of the solution.\n\nScenario #2: Interface Reliance: Developers assume that only authorized users will be able to see the existence of a particular function on their mobile app. Hence, they expect that only legitimately authorized users will be able to issue the request for the service from their mobile devices. The back-end code that processes the request does not bother to verify that the identity associated with the request is entitled to execute the service. Hence, adversaries are able to perform remote administrative functionality using fairly low-privilege user accounts.\n\nScenario #3: Usability Requirements: Due to usability requirements, mobile apps allow for passwords that are 4 digits long. The server code correctly stores a hashed version of the password. However, due to the severely short length of the password, an adversary will be able to quickly deduce the original passwords using rainbow hash tables. If the password file (or data store) on the server is compromised, an adversary will be able to quickly deduce users’ passwords.\n\nScenario #4: Insecure Direct Object Reference: A user makes an API endpoint request to a backend REST API that includes an actor ID and an OAuth bearer token. The user includes their actor ID as part of the incoming URL and includes the access token as a standard header in the request. The backend verifies the presence of the bearer token but fails to validate the actor ID associated with the bearer token. As a result, the user can tweak the actor ID and attain the account information of other users as part of the REST API request.\n\nScenario #5: Transmission of LDAP roles: A user makes an API endpoint request to a backend REST API that includes a standard oAuth bearer token along with a header that includes a list of LDAP groups that the user belongs to. The backend request validates the bearer token and then inspects the incoming LDAP groups for the right group membership before continuing on to the sensitive functionality. However, the backend system does not perform an independent validation of LDAP group membership and instead relies upon the incoming LDAP information coming from the user. The user can tweak the incoming header and report to be a member of any LDAP group arbitrarily and perform administrative functionality.</div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>REMEDIATION : </b><br><br>Avoid Weak Patterns\n\nInsecure Mobile Application Authentication Design Patterns should be avoided:<br><br>\n\nIf you are porting a web application to a mobile equivalent, ensure the authentication requirements of mobile applications match that of the web application component.

Weak cryptography can enable attackers to decrypt the intercepted data, modify it, and re-encrypt it before forwarding it to the intended recipient. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or the injection of malicious content.\n\nScenario #2: Brute-Force Attacks- Attackers systematically try various combinations of keys until they find the correct one to decrypt the data. Weak cryptography can shorten the time required for such attacks, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\nScenario #3: Cryptographic Downgrade Attacks - Mobile applications may support multiple encryption protocols or algorithms to establish secure connections. If weak cryptography is allowed as a fallback option, attackers can exploit this weakness and force the application to use weak encryption. As a result, they can decrypt the intercepted data more easily and launch subsequent attacks.\n\nScenario #4: Key Management Vulnerabilities - Weak key management practices can undermine the security of the cryptographic systems used in mobile applications. For example, if encryption keys are stored insecurely or are easily guessable, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the keys and decrypt the encrypted data. This can result in data breaches and privacy violations.\n\nScenario #5: Crypto Implementation Flaws - Weak cryptography can also stem from implementation flaws in the mobile application itself. These flaws may include incorrect usage of cryptographic libraries, insecure key generation, improper random number generation, or insecure handling of encryption-related functions. Attackers can exploit these flaws to bypass or weaken the encryption protections.</div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>REMEDIATION : </b><br><br>To prevent “insufficient cryptography” vulnerabilities in the mobile application, consider the following best practices:<br><br>\n\nUse Strong Encryption Algorithms: Implement widely accepted and secure encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Stay updated with current cryptographic standards and avoid deprecated or weak algorithms.<br><br>\n\nEnsure Sufficient Key Length: Select encryption keys with an appropriate length to ensure strong cryptographic strength. Follow industry recommendations for key lengths, considering the specific encryption algorithm being used.<br><br>\n\nFollow Secure Key Management Practices: Employ secure key management techniques, such as using key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs) to securely store encryption keys. Protect keys from unauthorized access, including restricting access to authorized personnel, encrypting keys at rest, and using secure key distribution mechanisms.<br><br>\n\nImplement Encryption Correctly: Carefully implement encryption and decryption processes in the mobile application, adhering to established cryptographic libraries and frameworks. Avoid custom encryption implementations, as they are more prone to errors and vulnerabilities.<br><br>\n\nSecure Storage of Encryption Keys: Ensure encryption keys are securely stored on the mobile device. Avoid storing keys in plain text or easily accessible locations. Consider using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or utilizing hardware-based secure storage options.<br><br>\n\nEmploy Secure Transport Layer: Use secure transport layer protocols, such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure), for transmitting encrypted data over networks. Implement proper certificate validation and ensure secure communication channels between the mobile app and backend systems.<br><br>\n\nValidate and Authenticate: Implement strong validation and authentication mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of parties involved in the encryption process. Perform proper validation of certificates, digital signatures, or other mechanisms used for authentication.<br><br>\n\nRegularly Update Security Measures: Stay informed about security updates, patches, and recommendations from cryptographic libraries, frameworks, and platform providers. Keep the mobile application and underlying cryptographic components up to date to address any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses.<br><br>\n\nConduct Security Testing: Perform thorough security testing, including cryptographic vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews. Identify and remediate any weaknesses or vulnerabilities discovered during the testing process.<br><br>\n\nFollow Industry Standards and Best Practices: Stay updated with industry standards and best practices related to cryptography. Organizations like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) provide guidelines and recommendations for secure cryptographic practices.<br><br>\n\nUse Strong Hash Functions: Choose widely recognized and cryptographically secure hash functions like SHA-256 or bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks and provide a high level of security.<br><br>\n\nImplement Salting: Always use a strong random salt when hashing passwords. Salting adds an extra layer of security by making it harder for attackers to use precomputed tables or rainbow tables to crack passwords.<br><br>\n\nUse Key Derivation Functions (KDFs): For password hashing, use Key Derivation Functions like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt. These functions are specifically designed for securely deriving cryptographic keys from passwords and provide additional security features like iteration counts to slow down brute-force attacks.<br><br></div>","symbolSize":2,"collapsed":true,"lineStyle":{"width":0.5},"itemStyle":{"borderWidth":1,"gapWidth":1}},{"name":"Insecure Authorization","value":"<div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>VUL : </b>Insecure Authorization</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>YEAR : </b>2022</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>DESCRIPTION : </b><br><br>Threat agents that exploit authentication and authorization vulnerabilities typically do so through automated attacks that use available or custom-built tools.</div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>EXAMPLE : </b><br><br>Scenario #1: Hidden Service Requests: Developers assume that only authenticated users will be able to generate a service request that the mobile app submits to its backend for processing.

In addition, the code in the binary could be valuable on its own, for example, because it contains critical business logic or pre-trained AI models. Some attackers might also not target the app itself but use it to explore potential weaknesses of the corresponding backend to prepare for an attack.<br><br>\n\nBesides collecting information, attackers could also manipulate app binaries to access paid features for free or to bypass other security checks. In the worst case, popular apps could be modified to contain malicious code and be distributed via third-party app stores or under a new name to exploit unsuspecting users. One common attack example is reconfiguring the payment identifiers in an app, repackaging it, and distributing it via app stores. Then, when users download this unauthorized copy from the app store, the attacker receives the payments instead of the original provider.<br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>EXAMPLE : </b><br><br>Scenario #1  <br><br>\nHardcoded API keys: Assume an app uses a commercial API where it must pay a small fee for each call. These calls would be easily paid for by the subscription fee the users pay for that app. However, the API key used for access and billing is hardcoded in the app’s unprotected binary code. An attacker who wants access could reverse engineer the app with free tools and get access to the secret string. Since API access is only protected with the API key and no additional user authentication, the attacker can freely work on the API or even sell the API key. In the worst case, the API keys could be misused a lot, causing substantial financial damage to the provider of the app, or at least blocking legitimate users of the app if the API access is rate-limited. <br><br>\n\nScenario #2 <br><br>\n Disabling payment and license checks: A mobile game might publish its app and the first levels for free. If the users like the game, they pay for full access. All the resources for the later levels are shipped with the app. They are only protected by a license check, where the license is downloaded when the user pays. An attacker could reverse engineer the app and try to understand how the verification of the payment happens. If the app binary is not sufficiently protected, it is easy to locate the license check and just replace it with a static success statement. The attacker can then recompile the app and play it for free or even sell it under another name in the app stores. <br><br>\n\nScenario #3  <br><br>\nHardcoded AI models: Assume a medical app that features an AI to answer user requests given as speech or free text inputs needs. This app includes its specialized and quality-assured AI model in its source code to enable offline access and avoid hosting own download servers. This AI model is the most valuable asset of this app and took many person-years in development. An attacker might try to extract this model from the source code and sell it to competitors. If the app binary is insufficiently protected, the attacker could not only access the AI model, but also learn how it is used, selling this information along with the AI training parameters. <br><br></div><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><br><b>REMEDIATION : </b><br><br>For each app, it should be assessed whether any critical content is contained in the binary or whether its popularity mandates binary protection. If yes, a threat modeling analysis helps to identify the highest risks and their expected financial impact in case they occur. For the most relevant risks, countermeasures should be taken.<br><br>\n\nApps always run in untrusted execution environments and should only get the least necessary information they need to work, as this information is always at risk of being leaked or manipulated. But assuming that certain secrets, algorithms, security checks, and similar must be within the app’s binary, different attacks can be fended off by different means:<br><br>\n\nReverse engineering: To prevent reverse engineering, the app binary should be made incomprehensible. This is supported by many free and commercial obfuscation tools. Compiling part of apps natively (iOS and Android) or using interpreters or nested virtual machines makes reverse engineering even harder, as many decompiling tools only support one language and binary format. This kind of obfuscation is a tradeoff between the complexity of the code and robustness against reverse engineering, as many libraries that rely on certain strings or symbols in the code will not work with full obfuscation. Developers could check the quality of their obfuscation by using the tools from the previous section.<br><br>\n\nBreaking security mechanisms: Obfuscation also helps against manipulation, as an attacker must understand the control flow in order to skip security checks and like. In addition, local security checks should also be enforced by the backend. For example, required resources for a protected feature should only be downloaded if a check succeeds locally and in the backend. Finally, integrity checks could detect code tampering and render the app installation unusable, e.g., by deleting some resources. However, such an integrity check could also be found and deactivated as any other local security check.<br><br>\n\nRedistribution (with malicious code): Integrity checks, e.g., on startup, could also detect redistribution and modification of app binaries. These violations could automatically be reported to find and remove the unauthorized copies of the app from the app stores before they become widespread. There are also specialized companies that support this use case.<br><br></div>","symbolSize":2,"collapsed":true,"lineStyle":{"width":0.5},"itemStyle":{"borderWidth":1,"gapWidth":1}}],"symbol":"image://data:image/svg+xml;base64,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","symbolSize":20,"lineStyle":{"width":0.5},"itemStyle":{"borderWidth":1,"gapWidth":7}},{"name":"LLM","value":"<div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\">The OWASP guide for LLMs focuses on vulnerabilities in AI systems, such as prompt injection, data leakage, and model manipulation, promoting secure deployment and usage of generative AI technologies.</div><br>","children":[{"name":"Prompt Injection","value":"<div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>VUL : </b>Prompt Injection</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>YEAR : </b>2025</div><br><div style=\"text-wrap: wrap\"><b>DESCRIPTION : </b><br><br>A vulnerability where malicious or unintended user inputs manipulate a large language model (LLM) to alter its behavior or output, often bypassing safeguards.

Misinformation occurs when LLMs produce false or misleading information that appears credible. This vulnerability can lead to security breaches, reputational damage, and legal liability. \n\nOne of the major causes of misinformation is hallucination—when the LLM generates content that seems accurate but is fabricated. Hallucinations occur when LLMs fill gaps in their training data using statistical patterns, without truly understanding the content. As a result, the model may produce answers that sound correct but are completely unfounded.

Avoid open-ended extensions<br><br>\nOWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications v2.0<br><br>\ngenai.owasp.org 24<br><br>\nAvoid the use of open-ended extensions where possible (e.g., run a shell command, fetch a\nURL, etc.) and use extensions with more granular functionality. For example, an LLM-based\napp may need to write some output to a file. If this were implemented using an extension to\nrun a shell function then the scope for undesirable actions is very large (any other shell\ncommand could be executed). A more secure alternative would be to build a specific filewriting extension that only implements that specific functionality.<br><br>\n4. Minimize extension permissions<br><br>\nLimit the permissions that LLM extensions are granted to other systems to the minimum\nnecessary in order to limit the scope of undesirable actions. For example, an LLM agent that\nuses a product database in order to make purchase recommendations to a customer might\nonly need read access to a 'products' table; it should not have access to other tables, nor the\nability to insert, update or delete records. This should be enforced by applying appropriate\ndatabase permissions for the identity that the LLM extension uses to connect to the\ndatabase.<br><br>\n5. Execute extensions in user's context<br><br>\nTrack user authorization and security scope to ensure actions taken on behalf of a user are\nexecuted on downstream systems in the context of that specific user, and with the minimum\nprivileges necessary. For example, an LLM extension that reads a user's code repo should\nrequire the user to authenticate via OAuth and with the minimum scope required.<br><br>\n6. Require user approval<br><br>\nUtilise human-in-the-loop control to require a human to approve high-impact actions before\nthey are taken. This may be implemented in a downstream system (outside the scope of the\nLLM application) or within the LLM extension itself. For example, an LLM-based app that\ncreates and posts social media content on behalf of a user should include a user approval\nroutine within the extension that implements the 'post' operation.\n7. Complete mediation<br><br>\nImplement authorization in downstream systems rather than relying on an LLM to decide if an\naction is allowed or not. Enforce the complete mediation principle so that all requests made\nto downstream systems via extensions are validated against security policies.<br><br>\n8. Sanitise LLM inputs and outputs<br><br>\nFollow secure coding best practice, such as applying OWASP’s recommendations in ASVS\n(Application Security Verification Standard), with a particularly strong focus on input\nsanitisation.
